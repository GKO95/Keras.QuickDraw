# QuickDraw.keras_cnn
This is a team project done by students in Kyonggi University to duplicate the Google's Quick, Draw! online game as close as possible.
Since the pre-processed dataset is used directly by downloading to local directory, all of those huge-size dataset files could not be
uploaded to GitHub due to upload restriction to 100 MB.
