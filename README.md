# QuickDraw.keras_cnn
This is a team project done by students in Kyonggi University to duplicate the Google's Quick, Draw! online game as close as possible.
Since the pre-processed dataset is used directly by downloading to local directory, all of those huge-size dataset files could not be
uploaded to GitHub due to upload restriction to 100 MB.

For those who want to see complete project, the OneDrive link is provided where the project with the report handed in on final evaluation can be downloaded [here](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Agn_rXycf1K4gYlDqAnb7RarCeaWEg).
